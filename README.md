This is the repo for a mutant problem to the traditional price collecting steiner tree problem where nodes hold both the cost and the reward. And we are changing the threshold to see change in performance. Implementation is complete. 

Usage: In the test.py either use the randomTree function or build treeNode and treeEdge to generate a tree.
